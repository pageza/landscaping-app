## Incident Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection and Analysis (DETECT)

#### Initial Detection
1. **Automated Monitoring**
   - Security monitoring systems trigger alerts
   - Intrusion detection systems identify threats
   - Log analysis tools detect anomalies
   - Customer reports security concerns

2. **Validation Process**
   ```bash
   # Quick validation checklist
   - Verify alert authenticity (not false positive)
   - Assess immediate threat level
   - Gather initial evidence
   - Document discovery time and method
   ```

3. **Initial Classification**
   - Assign preliminary severity level
   - Identify affected systems/data
   - Estimate potential impact scope
   - Activate appropriate response procedures

#### Evidence Collection
```bash
# System information gathering
sudo netstat -tulpn > network_connections_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt
sudo ps aux > running_processes_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt
sudo last -n 50 > recent_logins_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt

# Log file preservation
sudo cp /var/log/auth.log /incident_evidence/auth_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log
sudo cp /var/log/syslog /incident_evidence/syslog_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log

# Database activity logs
psql -c "SELECT * FROM rls_audit_log WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';" > db_audit_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log
```

### Phase 2: Containment (CONTAIN)

#### Immediate Containment
1. **Critical System Isolation**
   ```bash
   # Block suspicious IP addresses
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -s SUSPICIOUS_IP -j DROP
   
   # Disable compromised user accounts
   psql -c "UPDATE users SET status = 'suspended' WHERE id = 'COMPROMISED_USER_ID';"
   
   # Rotate API keys and tokens
   # (Implement automated key rotation procedures)
   ```

2. **Access Control Measures**
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Implement emergency access restrictions
   - Enable enhanced monitoring and logging
   - Isolate affected network segments

3. **Data Protection**
   ```sql
   -- Emergency RLS policy tightening
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS emergency_lockdown ON sensitive_table;
   CREATE POLICY emergency_lockdown ON sensitive_table 
   FOR ALL USING (false); -- Deny all access temporarily
   ```

#### Short-term Containment
1. **System Hardening**
   - Apply emergency security patches
   - Update firewall rules
   - Enhance monitoring coverage
   - Implement additional access controls

2. **Communication Preparation**
   - Draft internal status updates
   - Prepare customer notifications
   - Document containment actions
   - Assess regulatory notification requirements

### Phase 3: Eradication (ELIMINATE)

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Technical Investigation**
   - Analyze attack vectors and methods
   - Identify exploited vulnerabilities
   - Assess timeline and scope of compromise
   - Document all findings and evidence

2. **System Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # Remove malware and backdoors
   sudo clamscan -r /var/www/html --infected --remove
   
   # Update all system packages
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   
   # Reset compromised configurations
   sudo cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.backup /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

3. **Vulnerability Remediation**
   - Patch identified security vulnerabilities
   - Update application code and dependencies
   - Strengthen security configurations
   - Implement additional security controls

### Phase 4: Recovery (RESTORE)

#### System Restoration
1. **Gradual Service Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Restore from clean backups if necessary
   psql < clean_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
   
   # Restart services with enhanced monitoring
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   sudo systemctl start postgresql
   sudo systemctl start redis
   
   # Verify system integrity
   sudo aide --check
   ```

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Implement additional security monitoring
   - Enable detailed audit logging
   - Increase alert sensitivity temporarily
   - Monitor for signs of reinfection

3. **Validation Testing**
   - Verify system functionality
   - Test security controls
   - Confirm data integrity
   - Validate backup/recovery procedures
