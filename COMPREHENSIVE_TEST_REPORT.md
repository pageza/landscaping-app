## Test Scenario Results

### ‚úÖ Customer Journey Testing (100% Success)

#### Scenario A: New Customer Onboarding
- **Duration:** 3m 45s
- **Steps Completed:**
  1. Registration form completion
  2. Property details entry
  3. Service selection (lawn mowing + hedge trimming)
  4. Pricing calculation: $125.50
  5. Same-day discount applied: -$12.55
  6. Final booking: $112.95
  7. Confirmation reference: #LNK-2024-001234

#### Scenario B: Existing Customer Service Addition

- **Customer:** John Smith (existing)
- **Loyalty discount:** 10% applied
- **Final price:** $95.00

- **Duration:** 2m 30s
- **Customer:** Amanda Foster (office complex)
- **Services:** Multiple with volume discount
- **Annual contract rate:** 15% discount
- **Final price:** $850.00

### ‚ùå Pricing Validation (0% Success - Algorithm Needs Refinement)

The pricing algorithm revealed significant calibration issues:

| Property Size | Expected Range | Actual Price | Status | Issue |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| 800 sq ft | $90-120 | $25 | ‚ùå Failed | Too low |
| 3,500 sq ft | $110-150 | $221 | ‚ùå Failed | Too high |
| 15,000 sq ft | $300-500 | $3,675 | ‚ùå Failed | Far too high |
| 25,000 sq ft | $500-800 | $4,568 | ‚ùå Failed | Far too high |

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Base rate of $0.035/sq ft is inappropriate for the service model
- Service multipliers create excessive compound pricing
- Minimum pricing floors need implementation
- Property type multipliers are too aggressive

**Recommended Pricing Model:**
```
Base Service Rate: $75 (minimum)
Size Multiplier: $0.008/sq ft for residential, $0.005/sq ft for commercial
Service Add-ons: Fixed rates rather than multipliers
Property Type Adjustments: 10-20% rather than 40-80%
```
